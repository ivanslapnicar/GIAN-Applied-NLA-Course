# Modern Applications of Numerical Linear Algebra Methods

This is the collection of notebooks for the course
_Modern Applications of Numerical Linear Algebra Methods_.


The original GIAN Course was held from _June 26, 2016_ to _July 5, 2016_ at IIT Indore. The notebooks are currently being used in the course "Numerical Linear Algebra" at the University of Split.

Here are some links:
* [Global Initiative of Academic Networks](http://www.gian.iitkgp.ac.in/)
* [List of Approved Courses](http://www.gian.iitkgp.ac.in/ccourses/approvecourses2)
* [Course Description](BR1458109755Final_Modern_Applications_of_Numerical_Linear_Algebra_Methods.PDF)
* [Indian Institute of Technology, Indore](http://www.iiti.ac.in/)

The notebooks are using [Julia](http://julialang.org/) programming language. To start using Julia see the
[Julia Course](https://github.com/ivanslapnicar/Julia-Course)

The Pluto notebooks (ending in `.jl`) are updated to the new Julia versions.

The Jupyter notebooks (ending in `.ipyinb`) and PDF files are outdated, but are also provided.

The notebooks are divided into two modules:

* Eigenvalue and Singular Value Decompositions
* Applications


The naming scheme of the notebooks is the following:

* lectures start with `L`,
* tutorial assignments start with `T`, and
* solutions to tutorial assignments start with`S`.


The notebooks can be used in two ways:

1. Browsing:

* [Pluto notebooks](https://ivanslapnicar.github.io/GIAN-Applied-NLA-Course/)
* [Jupyter notebooks](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/ivanslapnicar/GIAN-Applied-NLA-Course/tree/master/src/)

2. Cloning the notebooks to your computer with the command (in Linux)

    `git clone https://github.com/ivanslapnicar/GIAN-Applied-NLA-Course.git`

    For Windows, you can install the [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/)
    and use it to clone the repository, or download the zip file.

    The notebooks are now located in the directory `GIAN-Applied-NLA-Course/src/` and can
be used interactively.

Author's concept behind the creation of the course is in the [Manifest](src/Manifest.md).
