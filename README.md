The course was held from _June 26, 2016_ to _July 5, 2016_ at IIT Indore. The notebooks are currently being used in the course "Numerical Linear Algebra" at the University of Split.

* [Indian Institute of Technology, Indore](http://www.iiti.ac.in/)


The course consists of three modules:

* Module A - Short Julia Course
* Module B - Eigenvalue and Singular Value Decompositions
* Module C - Applications

The course is presented through twenty  one-hour lectures and ten two-hour tutorials.

Course materials are using [Julia](http://julialang.org/) programming language
and are presented as Jupyter or Pluto notebooks.
The naming scheme of the notebooks is the following:

* lectures start with `L`,
* tutorial assignments start with `T`, and
* solutions to tutorial assignments start with`S`.

PDF files (may be outdated) for the three modules are also provided. Meanwhile, the notebooks are being updated and ported to the current version of Julia.

To understand the author's concepts behind the creation of the course,
read the [Manifest](src/Manifest.md).

The notebooks can be used in three ways:

1. Browsing:
* [Jupyter notebooks](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/ivanslapnicar/GIAN-Applied-NLA-Course/tree/master/src/)
* [Pluto notebooks](https://ivanslapnicar.github.io/GIAN-Applied-NLA-Course/)
2. Cloning the notebooks to your computer with the command (in Linux)

    `git clone https://github.com/ivanslapnicar/GIAN-Applied-NLA-Course.git`

    For Windows, you can install the [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/)
    and use it to clone the repository, or download the zip file.

    The notebooks are now located in the directory `GIAN-Applied-NLA-Course/src/` and can
be used interactively as described in the notebook
[L00 Installing and Running Julia](https://ivanslapnicar.github.io/GIAN-Applied-NLA-Course/L00 Installing and Running Julia.jl.html).

PDF files used in original course are in the directory `src/pdf`.
PDF files of some updated notebooks are in the directory `src/pdf/new`.
